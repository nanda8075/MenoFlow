### The Problem statement

:
Millions of individuals experience challenges in tracking their menstrual cycles, understanding mood swings, and maintaining proper nutrition and exercise routines. Additionally, conditions like PCOD, PCOS, and postpartum discomforts require personalized monitoring and recommendations.

Furthermore, pregnancy tracking requires careful monitoring of checkups, nutrition, and due dates, while postpartum individuals need structured support for recovery and lactation management.

This project aims to develop an intuitive, beginner-friendly web application that simplifies menstrual, pregnancy, and postpartum health tracking. The platform will include features such as cycle and symptom tracking, partner alerts, personalized diet and exercise recommendations, pregnancy checkup reminders, and postpartum care insights. By integrating accessible and actionable insights, this solution will empower users to take charge of their reproductive health in an easy-to-use digital format.

For Hardware:
Hardware Requirements for the Project

Since this is a web-based application, hardware requirements are minimal. However, if you plan to integrate advanced features like AI-based analysis or IoT-based health monitoring in the future, you might need additional hardware.

Basic Hardware Requirements:

1. Development & Hosting:

Laptop/PC (for development & testing):

Minimum: Intel Core i5 (or equivalent), 8GB RAM, SSD storage

Recommended: Intel Core i7 (or equivalent), 16GB RAM, SSD/NVMe storage


Server (if self-hosted instead of using cloud services):

Minimum: Quad-core processor, 16GB RAM, 500GB SSD

Recommended: Dedicated cloud server (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean)



2. User Hardware Requirements:

Since the platform is web-based, users only need:

Smartphone, Tablet, or PC with a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).



---

Optional Advanced Hardware (For Future Expansion):

If you want to integrate health monitoring features in later versions, you might consider:

Wearable Devices (IoT Integration): Smartwatches (Apple Watch, Fitbit, Garmin) for heart rate, temperature, and cycle tracking.

Bluetooth Body Sensors: Body temperature, glucose level, and hydration tracking.

Smart Scales: For tracking weight and BMI changes over time.


For now, focusing on the web development hardware is enough, but you can explore IoT integration later for advanced health tracking.
